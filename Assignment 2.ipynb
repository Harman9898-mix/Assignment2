    "#Ans. A list is one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures. Here are some key features of lists:\n",
    "#  > Lists maintain the order of elements. This means that the items in a list have a defined sequence, and you can access them using their index.\n",
    "#  > Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after their creation. You can change elements, add new elements, or remove elements.\n",
    "#  > Lists can contain elements of different data types. This makes them flexible for storing a mix of items.\n",
